                    <p>Concepts are the building blocks of the knowledge structure in any discipline or subject. Conceptual clarity is, therefore, necessary in the subject to develop a proper understanding of the principles and theories of the subject. However, students often develop certain misconceptions related to a particular concept that hinder their learning in that subject. Identification of the misconceptions and its remediation is therefore an essential aspect of any instructional design.</p>

                    According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a concept is “an abstract or generic
                    idea generalized from particular instances”(Merriam-Webster, 2023).
                    Concepts are, thus, mental representations or abstractions formed through
                    generalization and that helps in communication (Langland-Hassan, et.al., 2022). <br><br>
                   <b> For example,</b> Force is a common concept in physics. Force is an abstraction or
                    a mental representation. This mental representation is constructed from
                    various instances of pull and push. Thus whenever the term is used it denotes
                    some sort of pull or push which is commonly understood by all those
                    communicating in science.

                       <h2>DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF CONCEPT</h2><br>
                       <div> <b>There are certain important points about concepts that we need to
                        understand before we try to see what concepts are: </b></div><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First of all, we should understand that concept is an idea where an idea
                                refers to some impression or some thought.</li><br>
                            <li>The idea is constructed through abstraction from several instances. This
                                construction of abstraction is sort of mental representation.</li><br>
                            <li>The mental representation or the abstraction is given a name. Thus the
                                term Force is the name given to the mental representation of push or
                                pull.</li><br><br>
                     <img src="assets/img/Screenshot (19).png" alt=""><br><br>
                            <li>What are these instances that you identified? These instances are
                                examples of the concept. Thus every concept has a number of examples.</li><br>
                            <li>Since a concept has several instances/examples, a concept is qualified as
                                generic in nature. The idea is generic because it represents a whole range
                                of entities that are similar to each other rather than any particular entity.
                                For example, Fruit is a concept. It is an impression for a wide range of
                                edible objects such as bananas, apples, etc. rather than some one
                                particular element.</li> <br>
                            <li>It is a generalized idea because it is constructed based on the
                                identification of the similarities in different instances of the concept.
                                For example, Heat is a concept in science metalanguage. There is
                                nothing concrete that we denote as Heat. Rather, scientists constructed
                                the term and use it in a generalized way to denote several instances of a
                                phenomenon involving hotness or coldness of the bodies.

                                and theories in the discipline are understood and communicated. </b></li>

                                    which half the air has been removed. <br>Fifteen per cent of the students sketched half the second bottle

                    <h3>MISCONCEPTIONS AND LEARNING</h3>
                    <p>The students have their own cognitive/knowledge structure related to
                        some learned concept. <br><br>The knowledge structure [ in a correct way or as a misconception]
                        constitutes the previous or the existing knowledge structure of the
                        learner. <br><br>The students are said to interpret new learning material through the lens
                        of their existing knowledge structure. Therefore, the previous
                        knowledge, [including the misconceptions] mediates the students’
                        learning of new materials involving the particular target concept. <br> <br>Since, the students, when faced with new learning material, interpret it
                        via their existing knowledge structure which includes the
                        misconceptions as well, the new learning is apt to be erroneous since it is
                        interpreted through the lens of misconception. <br><br>Thus the faulty conceptions in the previous knowledge structure (i.e.
                        misconception) are bound to interfere with the student’s future learning
                        in a negative way that can lead to further erroneous learning. <br><br>In the worst case, the misconceptions make it hard for the students to
                        learn the new material and as such the students get demotivated and
                        give up learning.</p>

                <h3>MISCONCEPTIONS AND TEACHERS’ ROLE</h3>
               <p>It is widely accepted that <br> <p style="padding-left: 5em;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">“Teachers who know their students' most common misconceptions are
                more likely to increase their students’ science knowledge than teachers
                who do not” (Sadler and Sonnert, 2016) </p><br>Therefore the teachers need to have an idea of their students’
                misconceptions. <br>The knowledge of students’ misconceptions helps the teacher to
                intervene in their learning, leading them towards conceptual clarity. <br>Therefore, a concerned teacher will always try to assess the students for
                any existing misconceptions in their class and remedy the same. <br> <br> <b>The teachers have to significant roles concerning misconceptions. The
                two roles are: </b>
                <ul> <li>Identification of the misconceptions.</li>
                     <li>Remedy the misconception through alternative instructional

            <ul style="font-size: 1em;">
               <li>A concept is “an abstract or generic idea generalized from
                particular instances”(Webster, 2023).</li><br>
               <li>Concepts are the building block of organized knowledge in science.</li><br>
               <li>An error in understanding of a concept different from that
                accepted by the scientific community as valid is known as
                Misconception.</li><br>
                <li>Misconceptions are invalid elements in the knowledge structure,
                    that are systematic errors and that are difficult to remove by
                    conventional teaching approaches.</li><br>
                <li>Misconceptions hinder students' learning and may lead to errors
                    in the future learning of students.</li><br>
                <li>Teachers need to identify and remedy the students’
                    misconceptions early in life.</li>
