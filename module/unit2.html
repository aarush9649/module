                        <p>Conceptual clarity is an essential prerequisite for future learning of scientific knowledge. However, misconceptions in science are simultaneously a universal phenomenon among students. It has also been established that students’ misconceptions have multiple sources. It can be due to errors in learning at home, certain cultural beliefs and even classroom instruction. <br><br>The misconception has been empirically validated to interfere with students’ future learning. As such it is important that the teachers pay attention to the misconceptions and make efforts to remedy them. <br> <br>Remediation of misconception demands remedial instructional plans different from conventional plans. It is therefore deemed important that the teachers know, in a simple way, the theoretical background of remediation strategies and the instructional approach based on them.  <br>The present module introduces you to the background knowledge of the phenomenon of conceptual change and cognitive conflict as the theoretical base for the remediation of misconceptions.

                    <p>Remediation of misconception refers to teachers' instructional
                        approach to remove the error in students' existing conception. The
                        remediation of the misconceptions is explained by the theory of
                        Conceptual Change mediated by a conflict in students' minds called
                        <b>Cognitive Conflict.</b></p>
                        <img src="assets\img\Screenshot (22).png" alt="">
                        <p>The fundamental remedial principle is that <b>any remedial
                            instructional design creates a cognitive conflict among the students
                            and motivates them for conceptual change.</b></p> <br><br><hr>
                        <h4>SAQ:</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">What are the two fundamental concepts underlying remedial
                           instruction for misconceptions?</p><hr>    
                </div>
                <div id="misconception"><h3>CONCEPTUAL CHANGE</h3>
                <div> Any remediation process is in essence a process of Conceptual
                    Change.  <br>
                    Conceptual Change is mediated by the state of cognitive conflict
                    created in students' minds which is often followed by instructional
                    facilitation by the teacher for conceptual change. <br>Conceptual change is about change in the existing conception to
                    match it with the valid and accepted conception. Conceptual change
                    involves the process of change in the student’s existing
                    knowledge/cognitive structure. <br><br>
                    <img src="assets\img\Screenshot (23).png" alt=""><br><br>
                    <div>
                  <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">The theory of Conceptual Change goes like this:</p>
                     <ul>
                            <li>Learning involves interaction with the learning materials.</li><br>
                            <li>This interaction between the learner and the material of learning is
                                mediated by the student’s existing knowledge popularly termed prior
                                knowledge or previous knowledge.</li><br>
                            <li>Any systematic error in existing knowledge structure related to some
                                particular idea or concept is referred to as a misconception. It is thus
                                some idea in the student's existing knowledge store related to the
                                target concept different from that accepted as valid by the scientific
                                community.</li><br> 
                                <img src="assets\img\Screenshot (24).png" alt=""><br><br>
                                <li>Since learning is mediated by the existing knowledge structure, any
                                    error or misconception in the structure hinders interpretation,
                                    organization and correct learning of the new material.</li>  <br>
                            <li>Since learning is mediated by the existing knowledge structure, any
                                error or misconception in the structure hinders interpretation,

                                <li>Rectification of the error is achieved by restructuring the prior
                                    knowledge structure. This restructuring of the prior knowledge
                                    involves a change commonly known as Conceptual Change (Schneider
                                    et al, 2012). Conceptual Change is thus a phenomenon of change.</li>

                     <h3>Cognitive Conflict:</h3> <br><br>
                     <p>Till now you have learned that conceptual change is a change in the
                        existing cognitive structure of the students related to some concept,
                        phenomenon or event. <br>
                        Conceptual change is the essence of any Remedial Instructional
                        strategy vis-a-vis misconception. The conceptual change is achieved
                        through the mediation of a motivational force in the form of cognitive
                        conflict. <br>
                        Cognitive conflict is a mental state that serves as a motivation to
                        initiate conceptual change. Thus the cognitive conflict is the driver for
                        the process of conceptual change. <br>Cognitive conflict is a “psychological state” of mind that acts as a
                        driver for the students to engage in the process of conceptual change. <br>
                        In a nutshell, the state of Cognitive Conflict arises whenever the
                        learner is placed in a conflicting condition where the conflicting
                        condition is an instructional situation in which the learner realizes
                        that the learned concepts in their prior knowledge could not help
                        them interpret some new learning material and it demands
                        restructuring (Vosniadou, 1994; Chi, 2008).

                            <p><b>You have learned thus far that</b> Cognitive conflict is the driving force behind
                                the conceptual change. For cognitive conflict to occur in a manageable and
                                teachable way, the teacher needs to design instruction such that it creates a
                                condition in which the students feel the conflict cognitively and desire to
                                overcome the conflict.

                                <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Thus there is a logical relationship between cognitive conflict and the
                                    conflicting condition/situation as described below:</p>
                            <ul>

                                         <li>The realization of the fallacy arises when the student fails to
                                            interpret some learning material or solve certain problems
                                            based on a given concept/idea relevant to the situation.</li><br>   
                                        <li>Thus the conflicting conditions are well planned and
                                            deliberately created by the teacher to help the learner find their
                                            knowledge structure deficient in some respect.</li><br>

                        <li>Remediation is the teacher's responsibility in case of students having
                            misconceptions.</li><br>
                        <li>Remediation involves creating a cognitive conflict and leading
                            towards conceptual change.</li><br>
                        <li>Conceptual Change involves the process of change in the student’s
                            existing knowledge/cognitive structure.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Conceptual Change is mediated by the cognitive conflict in students'
                            minds.</b></li><br>
                        <li>Cognitive conflict is a “psychological state” of mind that acts as a
                            driver for the students to engage in the process of conceptual change
                            (Waxer & Morton, 2012).</li>  <br>
                        <li>Cognitive Conflict is the driver of the process of conceptual change.</li> <br>
                        <li>A Teacher's role is to create a classroom situation or an instructional
                            situation that leads to the creation of cognitive conflict in students'
                            minds. This is the creation of conflicting conditions.</li> <br>
                         <li>The figure given below shows the relation between the three
                            important ideas vis-a-vis misconceptions.</li>
